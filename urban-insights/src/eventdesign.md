While your making the call to /processImage grab the user details and image details (the time where you populate borderschema details)

check if user does not have restriction on that regionId 

if it has then create a new event and save in database

in the ui for admin add notifications icon (It should have something like 1,2,3 ---> no. of events)

when admin clicks on that icon show the list of events 

In that events page 

Add buttons to clear all events (delete all events)

add button to download the events in txt or csv

Better send all events info , danger  and give separate buttons on them to filter those particular events as well 

Info: if user does not have restriction also create this event and save in database
